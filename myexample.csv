1,"Why is it considered essential to use animals in the drug discovery process, as mentioned in the document?","""The use of animals is essential to the drug discovery process. Animals are biologically very similar to humans. They have the same kind of structure both externally and internally and they might share more than 98% of the DNA with humans. Animals are susceptible to many of the same health problems as humans. They are small in comparison to humans, easy to care for, and easy to reproduce.""","System: Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer. 
If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know. Don't try to make up an answer.

Human: Why is it considered essential to use animals in the drug discovery process, as mentioned in the document?","Animals are considered essential in the drug discovery process because they share biological similarities with humans. This similarity in structure, DNA, and susceptibility to health problems allows scientists to study the effects of drugs and potential treatments on animals before testing them on humans. Additionally, animals are smaller, easier to care for, and easier to reproduce, making them practical and ethical choices for initial testing.",good,2024-03-01 12:10:43,2024-01-03 12:10:44
2,What biological similarities between animals and humans are highlighted as a reason for using animals in scientific research?,"Animals are biologically very similar to humans. They have the same kind of structure both externally(pair of eyes, ears etc), internally(a pair of lungs, liver etc) and they might share more than 98% of the DNA with humans.","System: Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer.

3,What are the key criteria that a chemical compound must meet before it can be used on animals?,"The compound has to be potent and selective. It needs to be able to kill the parasite inside the cell without harming the cell itself. Solubility: The compound must be able to dissolve in the stomach. Permeability: The compound must be able to penetrate through the cell membranes. Stability: The compound must remain stable and not be broken down by the liver, allowing it to persist in the body.","System: Given the following extracted parts of a long document and a question, create a final answer.
